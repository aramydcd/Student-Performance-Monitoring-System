# EduShield – Predictive Academic Analytics Hub 🛡️

**EduShield** is a data-driven monitoring system that uses Machine Learning to predict student performance and centralize academic resources.

## 🚀 Technical Highlights
- **GPA Forecasting:** Integrated Scikit-learn regression models to predict student outcomes.
- **Data Pipeline:** Utilized Pandas for real-time transformation of SQLite data into actionable charts.
- **Resource Management:** Robust file-upload and distribution system for academic documents.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Dashboard Framework:** Streamlit
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
- **Data Science:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Backend/DB:** Python, SQLite

## 📥 Quick Start
1. **Clone & Enter:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/edushield.git](https://github.com/yourusername/edushield.git)
   cd edushield

```

2. **Install Requirements:**
```bash
uv sync

```


3. **Launch Dashboard:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py

```



## 📈 Predictive Logic

The system analyzes the correlation between attendance percentages and internal assessment scores to generate a predicted GPA. This allows faculty to identify students requiring additional support before the final examination cycle.
